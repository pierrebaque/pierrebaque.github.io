![Me]({{site.url}}/img/me2.jpeg){:style="width: 200px;float: right;margin-right: 7px;margin-top: 7px;"}
I received an engineering degree in Applied Mathematics and a Masters degree in Operations Research from Ecole Polytechnique, in 2013. After working as a mathematical Engineer for Credit-Suisse in London, I joined the Computer Vision Laboratory at Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

Between 2014 and 2018, I pursued my PhD. under the supervision of Prof. Pascal Fua and François Fleuret. My research focuses on Deep Structured Learning and Variational Inference applied to Computer Vision and graphical models.  
​
In 2018, I founded [Neural Concept](www.neuralconcept.com), which is an EPFL spin-off developing 3D deep learning solutions for Computer Assisted Engineering.
