### Current Work
My research lies at the intersection between modern Computer Vision and Variational Inference. My goal is to combine deep-learning techniques with scalable inference algorithm in order to develop new structured learning methods.

I am currently focusing on learning Mean-Field Inference algorithm for Multi-Camera Pedestrian Detection and occlusion reasoning.
