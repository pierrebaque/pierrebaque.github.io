### Collaborations
I collaborated with Startup companies and industrial partners to develop innovative 
applied research products.

#### CarmenV2
I co-created the software [CarmenV2](http://www.efcables.com/nos-logiciels/) 
with Nicolas Drecq ([EF Cables](http://www.efcables.com/)).

This is a one of its kind software, which helps engineers design ropeway transportation
systems. We put the focus on efficiency, precision and on an intuitive interface. 

Notably, we developed automated implantation tool. Our algorithms are able to choose an 
optimal design on any kind of terrain profiles. This helps engineers speed-up their workflow
and improve cost efficiency for their clients.

I helped the startup company [Sonalytic](https://www.sonalytic.com/) improve its music re-identification algorithms. 
Since then, it has been acquired by [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com).
