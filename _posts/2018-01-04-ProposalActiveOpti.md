### Active learning of Neural Network proxies for aerodynamic optimization

##### Presentation 

Many practical continuous minimization problems, such as aerodynamic optimization, are not amenable to gradient-based optimization methods
because derivatives can not be computed directly. We recently showed 
that it is possible to train a Neural Network regressor as a proxy to the numerical simulator and optimise the proxy function via Gradient-Descent.   
However, in practice, each datapoint requires an expensive call to a numerical simulator. Therefore, we need to use active learning techniques or reinforcement learning-based strategies to optimally sample the initial dataset and re-use the simulator judiciously during the optimization phase.

##### Outcomes of the project
An efficient active learning strategy to take the best advantage of a limited number of calls to the simulator before and during the optimization process would have a strong theoretical and industrial impact.
