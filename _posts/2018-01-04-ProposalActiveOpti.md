### Gradient Descent optimisation using Neural Network proxies

##### Presentation 

Many practical continuous minimization problems are not amenable to standard optimization methods
because gradients can not be computed directly. Recent results obtained in our lab suggest 
that it is possible to train a Neural Network regressor as a proxy to the initial function. We then optimise the proxy function via Gradient-Descent. 
However, in practice, each datapoint requires an expensive call to a numerical simulator. Therefore, we need to use active learning techniques or reinforcement learning-based strategies to optimally sample the initial dataset and use the simulator judiciously during the optimization phase.

##### Outcomes of the project
An efficient active learning strategy to take the best advantage of a limited number of calls to the simulator before and during the optimization process would have a strong industrial impact.
