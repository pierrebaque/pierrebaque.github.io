### Talk about Mean-Fields in CERMICS

I was invited by Axel Parmentier to give a talk at CERMICS, the Applied Maths Laboratory of Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es.
I really enjoyed being there for the day and giving this presentation.

We had a very good chat after the talk about how Mean-Fields and Graphical Models.


I shared the [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxijKKbgC7wRSEJOMWViQkFZdGc/view?usp=sharing) of the presentation on my GDrive.
