### Shape Optimization using Geodesic Convolutional Networks

We published on Arxiv a paper about a new approach to Aerodynamic shape optimization. It improves upon previously used Kriging-based surrogate models for CFD optimization. This new contribution uses the Geometric Deep Learning methods that recently appeared in computer vision.
