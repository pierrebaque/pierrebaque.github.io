### Swisscom Meetup Presentation

I did a talk hosted by the [Swisscom Digital Lab](https://www.swisscom.ch/digital-lab) in Lausanne about a set of challenges in computer vision. This talk was aimed at a scientific audience without knowledge of modern vision or machine learning techniques. I tried to give a broad overview of state-of-the-art in CV while connecting it to my research interest, structured learning.  

I enjoyed a lot talking there and answering questions. Would be happy to do this talk again, so if you are organising an even where this could fit, please get in touch.
